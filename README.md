# Movie Data Visualization App

## Overview

The Movie Data Visualization App is a web application that allows users to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about movies. The app provides a user-friendly interface for data visualization, enabling users to gain insights into the dataset, make data-driven decisions, and communicate findings effectively.

## Features

- Data Visualization: The app offers various types of visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, pie charts, line charts, and heatmaps, to help users understand different aspects of the movie dataset.

- Interactive Dashboard: Users can select the type of visualization they want to explore through an intuitive dashboard.

- Data Presentation: In addition to visualizations, the app provides the underlying data in tabular format, making it accessible for users who want to delve deeper into the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: Streamlit is the core framework for building the web application. It simplifies web app development and provides a seamless user experience.

- Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It loads and processes the movie dataset.

- Plotly Express: Plotly Express is employed to create interactive data visualizations, such as charts and graphs.

- Python: The entire project is written in Python, which serves as the programming language to implement the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Anonymous-12-05/datavisualisatiion-app.git
   

2. Change into the project directory:
   
   cd project-dir
   

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   
   pip install -r requirement.txt
